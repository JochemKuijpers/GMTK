npc: You’re here!
player: Of course! It’s so good to see you!
npc: I know you had to come out from Ezamor 7 to meet me here.
player: Traffic was pretty light, so it was no problem for me.
npc: How has after-education been treating you?
player: As well as anyone else in this star-system I suppose.

npc: Did you hear about the magnetic storm over Tin-non?
player: Yeah! How fortunate the Observation Facility is there to study it!
npc: I know! I heard the next one shouldn’t be for another 780 cycles!
player: I can’t wait to hear about the data that comes of this historic event!
npc: It’s going to be so exciting!
player: How is your project with the summintime particles going?
npc: Really great! Having some trouble with the out-of-date equipment, but we’re having success working around it.
player: I remember that feeling.

npc: I have a good team though.
player: Oh really? That’s good to hear!
npc: Yeah, we have a Vinzerian with us now, her expertise is invaluable.
player: Excellent, I’ve heard great things of the educational systems in that nebula.
npc: Did you want anything to drink?
player: What do they have?
npc: Something they devised called ‘Lavender Lemonade’?
player: Is it any good?
npc: I’ve never had it myself, we can find out if you want.
player: Maybe later.
npc: I saw your reports on climate migrations the other day!
player: You did?! What did you think?

npc: It was fascinating!
player: You really think so?
npc: I never thought of it that way! Your metaphor using transmigratory birds was inspired!
player: Oh, you don’t have to go that far.
npc: Don’t be silly, it’s true!
player: Thank you, it means a lot coming from you.
npc: I’m sure I’m not alone in the sentiment.
